                        This Paper elaborates how the game The Stanley Parable by Davey Wreden allows the Player to create In-game emotions and if the Player brings emotions to the game?
Emotions consist of feelings, physical reactions and cognitive processes such as comparing known situations. In doing so, they help you to make more than 35,000 decisions every day. These decisions can be manipulated for one's own benefit. However, manipulation is not always negative. Art for example always manipulates emotions, so therefore design cannot be ‘neutral’ as well. Emotional design doesn't have to be scary because it's all around us. Some game developers are aware of that and have a focus on bringing in the emotions of the players into a game. As a result, a designed game can manipulate emotions for a worse or better gaming experience. This depends on whether the design focus is on exploitation for a benefit or for the player. The Stanleys Parable is a humanistic game that deliberately creates emotions to encourage the player to think critically and leave room for their own interpretation. It is no longer just there to escape from reality. Playing the game creates emotions that are carried into the real world and gives you consequently more opportunities to make more thoughtful decisions outside of the game.
